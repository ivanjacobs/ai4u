As an individual trader, you understand the importance of making
accurate predictions about the future price movements of a particular
asset. In today's fast-paced and highly competitive financial markets,
having a competitive advantage can make all the difference in terms of
profitability. One way to gain this advantage is by using machine
learning algorithms to predict the next day's first high or low and the
consequent next high or low in the same day of an asset.

\chapter*{Business Advantages}\label{business-advantages}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Business Advantages}

\markboth{Business Advantages}{Business Advantages}

Knowing the next day's first high or low and anticipating the subsequent
high or low within the same trading day can provide a trader with unique
opportunities for strategic decision-making. This information allows for
the optimization of entry and exit points, the setting of stop-loss and
take-profit levels, and the development of more precise trading
strategies. Here's an exploration of the trading opportunities that
arise from this knowledge:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Early Entry and Exit Points:} Armed with information about the
  next day's first high or low, a trader can position themselves
  strategically before the market opens. This early awareness enables
  them to enter trades at optimal levels, anticipating price movements
  based on the expected direction of the first major price swing.
\item
  \textbf{Intraday Trend Riding:} Knowing the subsequent high or low
  within the same trading day allows for the identification and
  exploitation of intraday trends. Traders can align their positions
  with the prevailing trend, maximizing profit potential by riding price
  movements during the day.
\item
  \textbf{Precision in Stop-Loss Placement:} Traders can set precise
  stop-loss orders based on the anticipated subsequent high or low. This
  enables more accurate risk management, reducing the likelihood of
  premature stop-outs in volatile market conditions.
\item
  \textbf{Scalping Opportunities:} Intraday traders, particularly
  scalpers, can benefit from the knowledge of the next day's first high
  or low and the subsequent price levels. Rapid execution of short-term
  trades can capitalize on small price movements, optimizing the
  potential for quick profits.
\item
  \textbf{Dynamic Adjustments to Trading Strategies:} Traders can
  dynamically adjust their trading strategies based on the unfolding
  market conditions. For instance, if the subsequent high or low is
  reached earlier than expected, traders may decide to exit positions or
  adjust their profit targets accordingly.
\item
  \textbf{Enhanced Risk-Reward Ratios:} The ability to anticipate
  subsequent price levels empowers traders to set more favorable
  risk-reward ratios. By having a clearer picture of potential price
  movements, traders can adjust their profit targets in relation to
  their risk tolerance, aiming for more lucrative returns.
\item
  \textbf{Volatility Exploitation:} Traders can capitalize on increased
  volatility during the day by aligning their positions with the
  anticipated subsequent high or low. Volatility can create trading
  opportunities, and being aware of key price levels enhances the
  ability to navigate and profit from market fluctuations.
\item
  \textbf{Algorithmic Trading Strategies:} Automated trading algorithms
  can be designed to execute trades based on the anticipated price
  movements. This includes algorithmic strategies that take advantage of
  intraday trends, breakout patterns, or mean reversion, leveraging the
  known high or low points.
\item
  \textbf{Strategic Option Trading:} Traders involved in options trading
  can use the information about the next day's first high or low and
  subsequent price levels to devise strategic option strategies. This
  includes constructing spreads, straddles, or strangles based on
  expected price movements.
\item
  \textbf{Early Reaction to Market News:} Traders can position
  themselves to react swiftly to market news or events that may impact
  prices during the trading day. This proactive approach allows for
  timely decision-making and the potential to capitalize on market
  reactions.
\end{enumerate}

It's important to note that while having insights into future price
levels can offer advantages, markets are inherently unpredictable, and
trading always involves risks. Traders should use such information
judiciously, incorporating it into a comprehensive trading plan that
considers risk management, market conditions, and the broader economic
landscape. Additionally, adherence to ethical and legal trading
practices is paramount.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\textbf{Scenario:}}

\markright{\textbf{Scenario:}}

You are an experienced trader actively engaged in the stock market.
Recognizing the significance of accurate price predictions, you decide
to develop a predictive model to forecast the next day's high and low
prices for a particular stock. Your goal is to use this information to
strategically plan your trades, optimizing entry and exit points and
ultimately improving your overall profitability.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/aitrader.jpg}
\end{center}

\textbf{Steps to take:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Data Collection:} You gather historical price data for the
  stock of interest, including daily opening, closing, high, and low
  prices. Additionally, you collect relevant market data such as trading
  volume, volatility, and any external factors that may influence the
  stock's performance.
\item
  \textbf{Feature Engineering:} Employing your knowledge of technical
  analysis, you create additional features derived from the raw price
  data. These could include moving averages, Relative Strength Index
  (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and other indicators commonly used in
  financial analysis.
\item
  \textbf{Machine Learning Model Selection:} You choose a machine
  learning model suited for time-series forecasting, such as a recurrent
  neural network (RNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), or a
  gradient boosting algorithm. The model should be capable of capturing
  patterns and trends in sequential data.
\item
  \textbf{Training the Model:} Using a subset of your historical data,
  you train the machine learning model to learn patterns and
  relationships between various features and the target variables (next
  day's high and low prices). You fine-tune the model parameters to
  enhance its predictive accuracy.
\item
  \textbf{Validation and Testing:} You validate the model's performance
  on a separate dataset that it hasn't seen during training. This step
  helps ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Once
  satisfied with the validation results, you proceed to test the model
  on an out-of-sample dataset.
\item
  \textbf{Implementation and Integration:} Once the model demonstrates
  robust predictive capabilities, you integrate it into your trading
  strategy. Before each trading day, you input the latest available data
  to generate predictions for the next day's high and low prices.
\item
  \textbf{Decision Support:} The predicted high and low prices serve as
  valuable inputs in your decision-making process. You use this
  information to set limit orders, stop-loss levels, and identify
  potential entry and exit points based on your risk tolerance and
  trading strategy.
\item
  \textbf{Continuous Monitoring and Iteration:} Recognizing the dynamic
  nature of financial markets, you continuously monitor the model's
  performance and iterate on its architecture or features as needed.
  This adaptive approach ensures that your predictive model remains
  relevant in changing market conditions.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Outcomes:}

By incorporating predictive analytics into your trading strategy, you
gain a competitive advantage. The ability to forecast the next day's
high and low prices empowers you to make more informed and strategic
trading decisions. This approach allows you to optimize your risk-reward
ratio, adapt to market trends, and potentially enhance your overall
trading performance.

It's important to note that while predictive models can offer valuable
insights, no forecasting method is foolproof. Risk management and a
thorough understanding of market dynamics remain crucial aspects of
successful trading.

In this scenario, you will use PyTorch to build a deep learning model
that can predict the next day's high and low prices of a particular
asset. you will start by collecting historical data on the asset's price
movements, as well as any relevant external factors that could impact
its price. you will then preprocess this data and split it into
training, validation, and test sets.

Next, you will design and train a PyTorch model using the training set.
you will use a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural
networks to capture the complex patterns and trends in the data. you
will also use techniques such as batch normalization and regularization
to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization
performance.

Once the model is trained, you will evaluate its performance on the
validation set. you will use metrics such as mean absolute error and
mean squared error to assess the model's accuracy and precision. If the
model performs well on the validation set, you will use it to make
predictions on the test set.

The next step will be to use the model to predict the next day's high
and low prices of the asset. you will feed the model with the current
day's price data and any other relevant information, and it will output
the predicted high and low prices for the next day. you will then
compare these predictions with the actual prices to assess the model's
accuracy.

Finally, you will use the model's predictions to inform your trading
decisions. By knowing the predicted high and low prices of the asset,
you can better anticipate its future price movements and make more
informed trading decisions.

This could give you a competitive advantage in the market, allowing you
to make more profitable trades and outperform your competitors.
Throughout this process, you will also provide detailed mathematical
proofs for each project, using PyTorch's built-in tensor operations and
mathematical functions. This will allow you to demonstrate the
mathematical underpinnings of the model and provide a deeper
understanding of how it works. In conclusion, by using PyTorch to
predict the next day's high and low prices of an asset, you can gain a
competitive advantage in the financial markets. By combining machine
learning algorithms with mathematical proofs, you can build a robust and
accurate model that can help you make more informed trading decisions
and achieve better results.

As an individual trader aiming to gain a competitive advantage in the
financial markets, let's explore a scenario where you employ predictive
analytics to forecast the next day's high and low prices. In this
example, you'll leverage historical price data, technical indicators,
and machine learning algorithms to inform your trading decisions.

\section{Python Virtual Environment}\label{python-virtual-environment}

A virtual environment in Python is a self-contained directory that
encapsulates a specific Python interpreter along with its own set of
libraries and dependencies. It allows you to create isolated
environments for different Python projects, each with its own set of
packages, without interfering with the system-wide Python installation.

Here are some key concepts related to virtual environments in Python:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Isolation:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A virtual environment provides a segregated space where you can
    install Python packages without affecting the global Python
    environment. This isolation is crucial when working on multiple
    projects that might require different versions of libraries or have
    conflicting dependencies.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Package Management:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    With a virtual environment, you can install, upgrade, and remove
    Python packages using tools like \texttt{pip} without affecting the
    rest of your system. This ensures that each project has its own set
    of dependencies.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Version Control:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Virtual environments help manage Python interpreter versions. You
    can create a virtual environment with a specific version of Python,
    ensuring consistency across different projects. This is particularly
    useful when transitioning between Python 2 and Python 3 or when
    working with different Python versions for compatibility reasons.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Dependency Management:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Virtual environments allow you to specify and manage dependencies
    for each project. You can create a \texttt{requirements.txt} file
    listing all the dependencies and their versions, making it easy for
    others to recreate the same environment.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Activation and Deactivation:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Activating a virtual environment modifies the system's \texttt{PATH}
    variable to prioritize the virtual environment's binaries. This
    means that when you run Python or use \texttt{pip}, it refers to the
    versions within the virtual environment. Once your work in the
    virtual environment is done, you can deactivate it to return to the
    global Python environment.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Cleaner Project Directories:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Virtual environments keep project directories clean by isolating
    project-specific dependencies. This makes it easier to share
    projects with others and avoids conflicts with system-wide packages.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Compatibility:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Virtual environments are compatible across operating systems. You
    can create a virtual environment on one machine, and someone else
    can recreate the same environment on a different machine by using
    the same configuration files (e.g., \texttt{requirements.txt}).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Built-in Modules:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Python comes with a built-in module called \texttt{venv} (since
    Python 3.3) for creating virtual environments. Additionally, popular
    third-party tools like \texttt{virtualenv} and \texttt{conda} can
    also be used to create virtual environments.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

To summarize, virtual environments in Python are a valuable tool for
managing project-specific dependencies, ensuring version consistency,
and maintaining a clean and organized development environment. They
contribute to better project portability, reproducibility, and efficient
collaboration among developers.

Creating Anaconda environments and virtual environments in Python can be
a straightforward process. Below are the steps for both Windows and
Linux:

\subsection{Creating an Anaconda
Environment:}\label{creating-an-anaconda-environment}

\subsubsection{For Windows:}\label{for-windows}

\begin{enumerate}

    Click on ``Home'' again, and you should see your environment name in
    the right pane.
  \item
    Click ``Install'' to install packages in the selected environment.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  To create a new environment using Conda, you can use the
  \texttt{conda\ create} command. Below are the basic steps:

  \subsection{Create a new Conda
  environment:}\label{create-a-new-conda-environment}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    \textbf{Open a terminal or command prompt:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      On Windows, you can use the Anaconda Prompt or any command prompt.
    \item
      On Linux or macOS, you can use a terminal.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Run the following command:}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ create }\AttributeTok{{-}{-}name}\NormalTok{ your\_environment\_name python=3.x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

    Replace \texttt{your\_environment\_name} with the desired name for
    your new environment, and \texttt{3.x} with the desired Python
    version (e.g., \texttt{3.8}).

    For example, to create an environment named ``myenv'' with Python
    3.8, you would run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ create }\AttributeTok{{-}{-}name}\NormalTok{ myenv python=3.8}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
  \item
    \textbf{Activate the new environment:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      On Windows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ activate your\_environment\_name}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
    \item
      On Linux or macOS:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{source}\NormalTok{ activate your\_environment\_name}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

      Replace \texttt{your\_environment\_name} with the name you
      provided earlier.
    \end{itemize}

    After activation, your command prompt or terminal should indicate
    that you are now working in the new environment.
  \item
    \textbf{Install additional packages (optional):}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      You can install additional packages in your new environment using
      \texttt{conda\ install} or \texttt{pip\ install} as needed. For
      example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ install numpy pandas}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Deactivate the environment (when done):}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      When you're finished working in the environment, you can
      deactivate it using the following command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ deactivate}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

      This will return you to the base (root) environment.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Note:}\label{note}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It's a good practice to include the Python version when creating a
    new environment to ensure compatibility.

  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These steps should help you create Anaconda environments and virtual
environments on both Windows and Linux systems. Adjust the environment
names and versions as needed.

So lets create and activate an anaconda environment for our project.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ create }\AttributeTok{{-}{-}name}\NormalTok{ dppa }\AttributeTok{{-}y}
\ExtensionTok{conda}\NormalTok{ activate dppa}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, bottomtitle=1mm, bottomrule=.15mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, breakable, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, left=2mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, arc=.35mm, toprule=.15mm, coltitle=black, colback=white, opacityback=0, toptitle=1mm, rightrule=.15mm, leftrule=.75mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6]

The given Bash command (\textbf{bash\_conda\_create?}) is a Conda
command used to create a new Conda environment. Let's break down the
components of the command:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{conda\ create}: This part of the command instructs Conda to
  create a new environment.
\item
  \texttt{-\/-name\ dppa}: This option specifies the name of the new
  environment. In this case, the environment is named ``dppa.'' You can
  replace ``dppa'' with any desired name for your environment.
\item
  \texttt{-y}: This option stands for ``yes'' and is used to
  automatically confirm and proceed with the installation without
  prompting the user for confirmation. Adding \texttt{-y} is useful,
  especially when you want to automate environment creation in scripts
  or ensure a smooth, non-interactive installation.
\end{itemize}

Putting it all together, the command
\texttt{conda\ create\ -\/-name\ dppa\ -y} creates a new Conda
environment named ``dppa'' without asking for user confirmation during
the process. This environment can later be activated and used for
specific Python projects, allowing for isolation and management of
dependencies.

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Data Collection}\label{data-collection-1}

\caption{\label{fig-plot}Plot Volatility, Volume, and Performance}

\end{figure}%

This code provides a visual representation of how these financial
indicators change over time as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-plot}.
Volatility is shown in blue, Volume in orange, and Performance in green.
The \texttt{rolling} function is used to calculate these metrics over a
specified window, providing a smoothed representation of their trends.
The resulting plot helps in understanding the historical behavior of
these indicators for the given stock. In the example, the
\texttt{yfinance} library is used to fetch historical stock data. You
can install it using the command \texttt{pip\ install\ yfinance}. Adjust
the \texttt{ticker\_symbol}, \texttt{start\_date}, and
\texttt{end\_date} variables according to your requirements.

Please note that using this approach, you can gather basic historical
price data. For more extensive financial data and external factors that
may influence stock performance, you may need to integrate other data
sources or APIs into your code.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Calculate Volatility:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Volatility is often measured as the standard deviation of the daily
    returns. In finance, it's a common metric used to assess the
    variability of a stock's price. The formula for calculating
    volatility is:
    \(\text{Volatility} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(R_i - \bar{R})^2}{N}}\)
    where \(R_i\) is the daily return, \(\bar{R}\) is the mean of daily
    returns, and \(N\) is the number of days (in this case, the rolling
    window of 252 days).
  \item
    Code for calculating volatility:

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{historical\_data[}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Volatility\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ historical\_data[}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Close\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{].rolling(window}\OperatorTok{=}\DecValTok{252}\NormalTok{).std() }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Calculate Volume:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Volume is often used as a measure of market activity. It represents
    the total number of shares traded in a day. In this case, the
    rolling mean over a window of 252 days is calculated to smooth out
    short-term fluctuations. The formula is straightforward:
    \(\text{Volume} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\text{Volume}_i}{N}\)
  \item
    Code for calculating volume:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{historical\_data[}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Volume\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{] }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ historical\_data[}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}Volume\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{].rolling(window}\OperatorTok{=}\DecValTok{252}\NormalTok{).mean()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Calculate Performance:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Performance is typically measured as the percentage change in the
    closing price from one day to the next. This helps assess the daily
    returns of the stock. The formula is:
    \[\text{Performance}_i = \frac{\text{Close}_{i} - \text{Close}_{i-1}}{\text{Close}_{i-1}}\times 100\]
    This represents the percentage change in the closing price from day
    (i-1) to day (i).

    Code for calculating performance:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Plotting:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Finally, the three indicators - Volatility, Volume, and Performance
    - are plotted using \texttt{matplotlib}. The different colors and
    labels are added to differentiate between the lines in the plot.
